  "plain": "Andy Shauf is a Canadian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Regina, Saskatchewan. He is mostly self-taught musician, accessing instruments at a young age through the Radio Shack outlet run by his parents. Born to a evangelical Christian family, Shauf began playing Christian music with his family and began professionally as a drummer for a Christian pop punk band.\n\nHe started his solo career in 2006 with his Independent release \u201cLove and the memories of It\u201d followed by \u201cGrandpa Songs\u201d in 2007.  He released  his debut album, Darker Days in 2009. Shortly after, he released two EPs, Waiting for the Sun to Leave and Sam Jones Feeds His Demons, before releasing his second studio album The Bearer of Bad News in 2012, which jump-started his career as a solo artist. Shauf\u2019s big-break came in 2016 when he released his third studio album, The Party, to critical acclaim. It featured Shauf\u2019s most popular song to date, \u201cThe Magician\u201d. The album was nominated for the Polaris Music Prize and received four nominations at the Juno Awards. Shauf has been noted for his practice of recording and arranging each instrument on his albums himself."
